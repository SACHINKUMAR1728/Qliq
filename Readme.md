## **Problem Statement**
Digital advertising in the Web3 space faces significant challenges due to the decentralized nature of the ecosystem and the unique attributes of its users. While NFTs have become a powerful representation of users' interests, achievements, and preferences, the current advertising models fail to leverage this data effectively. 

#### **Core Issues:**
1. **Lack of Precise Targeting**: Traditional Web2 models are ineffective in the privacy-focused Web3 environment, where cookie-based tracking is obsolete.
2. **Limited Monetization for Web3 Platforms**: Free content platforms struggle to monetize while maintaining their decentralized ethos.
3. **User Privacy Concerns**: Many advertising solutions compromise privacy, deterring Web3 users from engaging.

## **Proposed Solution**
We introduce **QliQ**, a Web3 Ad Network that leverages NFT metadata to enable targeted advertising, providing advertisers, publishers, and users with a seamless, privacy-respecting solution.  

#### **Key Features:**
1. **NFT-Based Targeting**: Advertisers can create campaigns that target users based on their NFT collections, ensuring highly relevant and personalized ads.
2. **Smart Revenue Models for Publishers**: Web3 content platforms can monetize without disrupting the user experience.
3. **Privacy-Preserving**: Built on Web3 principles, the platform respects user privacy while maintaining advertising efficacy.

## **Challenges Faced**
During the development of **QliQ**, we came across a few challenges that we had to overcome:

1. **MetaMask Wallet Integration**:  
   Integrating MetaMask for wallet authentication and connectivity was tricky and required careful handling to ensure a smooth experience for users.

2. **High Gas Prices**:  
   Running transactions on the blockchain came with high gas fees, so we had to optimize the contract interactions to minimize costs.

3. **Web3 RPC Provider Issue**:  
   The Web3 RPC provider didnâ€™t work with Ethers.js version 6, so we had to downgrade to an earlier version to make it compatible.

4. **Accessing NFT Data from Wallets**:  
   We had issues retrieving NFT data from user wallets, as there were inconsistencies in how the data was provided.

5. **Accessing IPFS Data**:  
   Retrieving and displaying data stored on IPFS using CIDs (Content Identifiers) was challenging due to delays and integration issues.
